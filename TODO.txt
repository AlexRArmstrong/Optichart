	---Some Bugs---
****************************
* If Pi boots before monitor, will have wrong screen size.

* When moving up line wise, if go from start up, will skip several lines: Problem
is that calculations are from top of viewport and that is well above the screen top.
Might be able to fix this by calculating from the center of viewport.

* In full screen mode, changing charts can sometimes lead to lines cut off. - I 
think this is due to charts not being exactly the same - don't all have the same
size lines in the same positions.


****************************
	---Things to Do---
****************************
* Fonts need full path specified - should only need a valid fond name in the
fonts dir.

* Snellen Font only has letters (normal and mirrored) but no numbers, symbols.

* Reduce network timeout when shutting down with network plugged in - Linux thing.

* Worth 4 Dot.

* Fixation spot

* Childrens pictures.

* Line, Section, Chart classes are somewhat fragile - if called with wrong
arguments, can crash the program.

* Move up/down, left/right functions are reversed from what the programmer expects.

* Use twice the character width for masking rather than twice the vertical line
size - this is a very small thing, and may not even be correct. Using the
character width would account for the fact that pixels aren't square, however,
using the vertical size gives us a square based on snellen ratio.

* A gradient across and up/down of strips. Go from distinct black/white to what
appears as gray.

* Similar a gradient of letters and background shades - from black letters/white
background to gray/gray ? or all the way to white letters/black background?

* Have Red/Green specifiable in chart file? Is this usefull?

* An option in the config file to set the screen resoulition?


****************************
	---Some Ideas---
****************************
* Notes on saving position across power cycles:

Every time we update the display, we write the coordinates of the viewport,
along with the current chart file out to a text file.  Then on startup, we
read this file and return to the most recent state.

* Maybe use systemd to monitor program and reboot automatically if something 
goes wrong.
