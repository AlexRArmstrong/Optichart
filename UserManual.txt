Welcome to the Optichart User Manual.  This manual covers basic setup and use.

==============================
Requires:
==============================
Python 2.7.6
Pygame 1.9.1

 Untested with any other versions - if you find some that work, let me know!

==============================
Optional:
==============================
pylirc 0.0.5

 Needed if using an IR Remote Control.
 
==============================
Instillation:
==============================
Once the prerequisites are installed, simply unpack the Optichart files into
their own directory.

==============================
Setup:
==============================
After instillation, several settings should be adjusted based on the physical
machine Optichart is running on.

- config.conf
In this file you need to set the monitor vertical and horizontal size. Simply 
use your handy tape measure and enter the values in millimeters. The vertical 
size is used to calculate dots per inch for scaling. Currently, the horizontal
size is not used, but it's a good idea to set it anyway. Next you need
to set the physical size the electronic chart should appear. Again using
millimeters.  Finally you need to set the lane length.  This is the distance
from the chart to the patients eye (again with the mm). The other settings in
this file (Font Directory and Default Font) should be fine if you are using a 
standard instillation.

- /charts 
This directory contains a sampling of charts, some standard, some not so much.
It is perfectly fine to leave this directory alone, but you may find you prefer
the charts in a different order or even want to make your own charts. To reorder
the charts, change their file names. Optichart starts by displaying the lowest 
numbered chart, and counting up. If you are interested in making your own charts,
check the 99-example-chart.chart file for examples and an explanation of the 
chart file syntax.

==============================
